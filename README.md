## üîß Customization

### Adding New Service Types
Edit `appointment-manager.js` and add new service types to the `serviceTypes` object:

```javascript
this.serviceTypes = {
  'oil_change': { name: 'Oil Change', duration: 45, wrapUp: 15 },
  'tire_rotation': { name: 'Seasonal Tire Rotation', duration: 45, wrapUp: 15 },
  'general_service': { name: 'General Check-up/Repair', duration: 45, wrapUp: 15 },
  'brake_service': { name: 'Brake Service', duration: 90, wrapUp: 15 } // New service
};
```

### Modifying Business Hours
Update the `businessHours` object in `appointment-manager.js`:

```javascript
this.businessHours = {
  start: '07:00',  // Earlier start time
  end: '18:00',    // Later end time
  lastAppointment: '17:00'  // Last appointment time
};
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Storage

Currently, the application uses in-memory storage for appointments. For production use, consider implementing:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL
- **Caching**: Redis for session management
- **File Storage**: For customer documents and service records

## üö® Production Considerations

1. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling and user feedback
5. **Database**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
6. **SSL**: Use HTTPS in production
7. **Environment Variables**: Secure all sensitive configuration

## üìû AI Integration

The agent integrates with AI services for:

- **Voice Calls**: Handle customer service calls
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand customer requests
- **Appointment Management**: Seamlessly book appointments
- **Customer Interaction**: Professional and helpful service
